<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science student currently focused on learning programming. I enjoy taking on challenging problems and love that "aha" moment when I finally find a solution.</p>

<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to join Stanford's "Code in Place 2024," where I learned coding in a multicultural environment. This experience deepened my passion for programming and expanded my perspective on collaboration.</p>

<p>In a hackathon, a coding competition where my team developed a software project, I had the chance to do the research and create a presentation for the project. This experience enhanced my teamwork and communication skills, allowing me to effectively share ideas with others.</p>

<p>Currently, I am also diving into web development to further strengthen my skills. I am always eager to learn, embrace new challenges, and grow as I strive to become a skilled software engineer.</p>
